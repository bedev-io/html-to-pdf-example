# HTML TO PDF EXAMPLE

This is an example of how to convert an HTML file to a PDF file easily using the `puppeteer` and `mustache` libraries.

The PDF file is generated by rendering a template HTML file with some fake data.

The PDF is an invoice example. All data is fake and the correspondences with any real data is purely coincidental.

Please don't try to pay the invoice, I repeat, it's fake üòÇ

If you want to pay me a beer, I can send my real IBAN üç∫ #justkidding
